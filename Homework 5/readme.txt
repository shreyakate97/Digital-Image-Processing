Problem 1: (b)
# Implementation : Design CNN, train and test on CIFAR10 dataset
# python file name: LeNet5_CNN_hw5_569.py

# Instruction to run the file: I used google colab and used their GPU, so you can 
either use google colab (the command to use GPU are in the code)

# if you choose to run the code on CPU, that will work too, it will take a longer time
